feat(gates): implement PR-B verify + DONE gates verification mechanism

Add automatic verification gates after task execution. Tasks now transition
through a 'verifying' state where configurable gates validate the implementation
before marking as succeeded. Failed gates trigger automatic retry with context.

## State Flow

```
executing → verifying → succeeded (gates pass)
                    ↓
                planning (gates fail, retry with context)
```

## Features

- **DoneGateRunner**: New gate execution framework
  - Sequential execution with fail-fast strategy
  - Subprocess execution with 300s timeout
  - stdout/stderr capture and duration tracking

- **Gate Types**: doctor (default), smoke, tests
  - Configurable via task.metadata.gates
  - Default to ["doctor"] if not specified

- **Result Persistence**:
  - Artifacts: store/artifacts/{task_id}/gate_results.json
  - Audit: task_audits table with GATE_VERIFICATION_RESULT
  - Metadata: gate_failure_context injected on failure

- **Automatic Retry**: Failed gates return to planning with failure context

## Implementation

### Created
- agentos/core/gates/done_gate.py (374 lines)
  - GateResult, GateRunResult dataclasses
  - DoneGateRunner class with full execution logic

### Modified
- agentos/core/gates/__init__.py: Export gate components
- agentos/core/task/state_machine.py: Add VERIFYING→QUEUED transition
- agentos/core/runner/task_runner.py: Integrate gate execution

### Tests
- tests/unit/gates/test_done_gate.py: 22 unit tests
- tests/integration/test_verify_loop.py: 14 integration tests
- Total: 36/36 PASSED ✓
- Includes critical "deliberate failure" acceptance test ✅

## Documentation

- TASK2_PR_B_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md: Full implementation details
- TASK2_PR_B_QUICK_REFERENCE.md: Usage guide
- TASK2_PR_B_VISUAL_FLOW.md: Visual diagrams
- TASK2_PR_B_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md: Executive summary

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

- ✅ Deliberate failure test scenario implemented and verified
- ✅ Gate results recorded in audit and artifacts
- ✅ State transitions: executing→verifying→succeeded/planning
- ✅ Default gates: doctor as default, smoke and tests optional
- ✅ Failure context injection for retry loop

## Performance

- Gate overhead: ~0.2s (doctor + smoke)
- Artifact size: 1-5 KB per run
- Fail-fast: Stops on first failure

## Breaking Changes

None. All changes are additive and backward compatible.
