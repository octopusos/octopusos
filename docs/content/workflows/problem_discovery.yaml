  Identify and frame a real problem worth solving.
  
  This workflow guides the process of collecting signals, framing the problem
  boundary, and defining what success looks like. It's designed for scenarios
  where the problem space is unclear or needs validation.

phases:
  - id: signal_collection
    description: Collect signals and evidence about the problem
    requires: []
    produces: [signals, evidence]

  - id: problem_framing
    description: Frame the problem boundary and scope
    requires: [signals]
    produces: [problem_statement, scope]
    allows_questions: true
    risk_level: medium

  - id: success_criteria
    description: Define what success looks like
    requires: [problem_statement]
    produces: [success_criteria, metrics]
